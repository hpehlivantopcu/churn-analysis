# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## What This Project Does
Analyzes telecom customer data to identify **why customers leave**, builds predictive models to **flag at-risk customers early**, and exports results ready for a **Tableau / Power BI dashboard**.

This mirrors the real work done during the US Cellular internship — analyzing 2M+ records, building churn models in Python/SQL, and delivering dashboards for leadership.

## Files in This Folder

| File | What It Is |
|---|---|
| `churn_analysis.py` | Full pipeline: EDA → preprocessing → 3 ML models → evaluation → export |
| `monthly_churn_trend.csv` | Output CSV generated by the script — monthly churn trend for dashboards |
| `README.md` | This file |

### Output Images (auto-generated when you run the script)
- `eda_churn_drivers.png` — 6-panel EDA chart
- `model_evaluation.png` — ROC curves + confusion matrix
- `feature_importance.png` — top churn drivers bar chart

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 2. Run the script
```bash
python churn_analysis.py
```
That's it — it prints model results to the console, generates the PNG charts, and writes the CSV.

### 3. (Optional) Use Jupyter instead
If you prefer a notebook, open Python and paste each section (marked with `# ───` headers) into separate cells.

## How to Swap In Real Data
The script currently uses `generate_telecom_data()` which creates a synthetic dataset.

To use a **real CSV**, find this line near the top:
```python
df = generate_telecom_data(n=5000)
```
Replace it with:
```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_actual_data.csv")
```
Then make sure your CSV column names match or update the column references in the EDA and modeling sections.
