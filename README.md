# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## What This Project Does
Analyzes telecom customer data to identify **why customers leave**, builds predictive models to **flag at-risk customers early**, and exports results ready for a **Tableau / Power BI dashboard**.

This mirrors the real work done during the US Cellular internship — analyzing 2M+ records, building churn models in Python/SQL, and delivering dashboards for leadership.
